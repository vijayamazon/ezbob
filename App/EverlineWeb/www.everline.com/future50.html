<p>Small firms are the lifeblood of our economy here in the UK, and with figures showing growth as we go into 2015, there’s never been a better time to spotlight the innovative start-ups helping to drive recovery.  Our exciting Everline Future 50 project aims to do just that.  Showcasing 50 of the UK’s hottest new or early stage businesses, the Everline 50 is a nationwide awards scheme that celebrates those companies blazing a trail in their field and the hunt is now underway to find this year’s exceptional candidates.
</p>
<p>These innovative rising stars can come from any sector – past winners include businesses from the worlds of ecommerce, property, veterinary, fashion, motoring and hospitality – but they all have one thing in common: they are all early disruptors, helping to trigger change in their field and overturning accepted notions of how things are done.
</p>
<img src="sites/default/files/wb/future50-meetandgreet.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; margin-right:15px;"><p>Launched four years ago by our partner, <a href="http://realbusiness.co.uk/magazine">Real Business</a> magazine, the Future 50 has already uncovered some of the most thrilling new names in business.&nbsp; Successful candidates aren’t merely thriving start-ups – the awards go to those who are genuinely ripping up the rule books and challenging convention by revolutionising just about everything we do, from the way we shop and travel, to how we communicate and spend money. </p>
<p>Here at Everline, we pride ourselves on being disruptive within the SME lending sector by providing fast, flexible and convenient finance to businesses who need it, and so the Future 50 awards are particularly close to our heart. We are delighted to be involved again this year and we can’t wait to see the new crop of talent out there.
</p>
<p>Excitingly, for the very first time, Everline and Real Business will be inviting last year’s Future 50 class to join the Future 50 academy to vote on who should be included in the 2015 line up.  Not only does this bring valuable expertise to the table but no one knows disruptive innovators better than those who’ve already succeeded with merit.</p>

            <strong>Can you give us a brief overview of you and your business?</strong><br>
            The online marketplace to buy and sell shares in UK private companies. We aid exits and equity release in later stage private equity.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has been your biggest achievement in the past 12 months?</strong><br>
            Trading over £18mln value, of unquoted shares. Having 1,700 (and growing) certified sophisticated users. Companies on the Platform have a total of 21,000 shareholders.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How have you been disruptive in your market during that time?</strong><br>
            As our nascent brand develops, more entities see us as an alternative to established stock markets.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why is being disruptive so important in the current business/economic climate?</strong><br>
            Our cost structure and technology delivers a superior product at fractional cost.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Is triggering change in your market, or creating a new one, critical to success?</strong><br>
            Probably 35% the former and 65% the latter.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What in your view is a great example of a business that has been disruptive in the past 12 months, and why?</strong><br>
            UBER. The technology both from the booking and meeting, homing in to the passengers, plus the apparent lack of need for ‘the knowledge’ required by traditional cabbies does not affect the service, which is also considerably cheaper.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has being named in the Future 50 helped you to achieve?</strong><br>
            Recognition by other innovative folk. The positive response to being part of the Future 50.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Has it opened up any opportunities?</strong><br>
            It was a very different dimension for us and we have been proud to note the award.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What sort of businesses are you hoping to see in the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            We are a FinTech business with some traditional finance services features. We like finance and electronic platform space generally. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>What advice would you give to businesses hoping to make the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            A passion to deliver and clarity of their business plan.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What do you think the biggest challenges UK business are currently facing?</strong><br>
            For early stage companies it’s probably about funding for 3 years, for others it may be slower growth rates generally that mean a business takes longer to achieve its goals. It does take longer than you think..!
            <br><br>
            <strong>Are there any other messages you would like to see communicated?</strong><br>
            Believe in what you’re doing but listen as well. Passion is key.

        <p style="font-size:0.85em;">
            <strong>Can you give us a brief overview of you and your business?</strong><br>
            I head up the product and technology for the Socialadgroup. We realised that with the right content, from the right people, at the right time talking about your brand can significantly boost your proposition - that’s why we built our company. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has been your biggest achievement in the past 12 months?</strong><br>
            Launching a ground breaking social media based advertising platform
            <br><br>
            <strong>How have you been disruptive in your market during that time?</strong><br>
            Using real-time social influence to draw people’s attention to the product in question.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why is being disruptive so important in the current business/economic climate?</strong><br>
            It allows us to stand out from the crowd and be noticed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Is triggering change in your market, or creating a new one, critical to success?</strong><br>
            I think you need to lead the change to a new market, being a lone wolf in a new market is difficult, you need to pull competitors along with you to help shape it
            <br><br>
            <strong>What in your view is a great example of a business that has been disruptive in the past 12 months, and why?</strong><br>
            I wish I could give you an answer to that; we have been exposed to hundreds of start-up companies, each one disrupting their niches. So I would say it's not about the single most disruptive business but the dilution of power to smaller, nimble teams that is really paving the way.
			<br><br>
			I guess you could say, the opportunity to disrupt traditional business is the most disruptive.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has being named in the Future 50 helped you to achieve?</strong><br>
            We have gained more recognition (and a few leads), it was good from a PR perspective, we are not very good at those ourselves.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Did it change the way you think or approach business? </strong><br>
            Yes, it puts us in the limelight, and as such we speak to a wider audience so we have to be creative in our approach to describing our business but also how we think about solving problems.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Has it opened up any opportunities?</strong><br>
            Yes, it has helped with attracting business.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What sort of businesses are you hoping to see in the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            Fun and engaging businesses, great ideas, smart people.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What advice would you give to businesses hoping to make the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            Make sure you present your business idea so that a child could understand it. As a start-up you usually end up trying to over describe your product in order to highlight its capabilities, Keep it high level, use fun analogies (not company comparisons) and let the audience come to you with questions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What do you think the biggest challenges UK business are currently facing?</strong><br>
            Resourcing is a big issue, there is not enough permanent tech resource out there, the contracting market seems to be a huge lure, so start-ups continuously find it hard to actually start.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Are there any other messages you would like to see communicated?</strong><br>
            If at first you don't succeed, try again, then try again, and again, and again, if that’s not worked, then give up. 
			<br><br>
			It takes a lot of hard work, you will end up with a completely different company to that you envisaged, but the hard work will pay off if you adapt to change and have thick skin

            <strong>Can you give us a brief overview of you and your business?</strong><br>
           Buy My Wardrobe is a designer fashion resale marketplace with a community at its heart. Launched to tackle the growing problems women face when selling their designer wardrobe items online, by addressing the key issues of trust, quality and authenticity we seek to disrupt a market that has been dominated by eBay for over a decade.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has been your biggest achievement in the past 12 months?</strong><br>
            We were chosen by Trinny Woodall to help her clear the contents of her over flowing wardrobe. We hosted a very successful event for her in our central London boutique.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How have you been disruptive in your market during that time?</strong><br>
            We have adopted a model of transparency to enable trust in a peer-to-peer environment. All our sellers are vetted and must use their real names and photos in their profiles. Community, trust and transparency is a key part of our offering - we've embraced social because social is more aligned with resale than other types of e-commerce. Every seller, every product and every transaction has a story and this is where we feel our competitors are missing a trick.

            <strong>Why is being disruptive so important in the current business/economic climate?</strong><br>
           The digital revolution has completely changed the world we live in - because we are more connected than we have ever been before businesses are moving at an incredibly fast pace. In order to be one of the winners, being different and embracing the change has never been more important.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Is triggering change in your market, or creating a new one, critical to success?</strong><br>
            I believe all industries will go through disruption, some already have and for others it is coming. What's clear is that the pressure to stay one step ahead has never been greater - that is the case for old companies and new.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What in your view is a great example of a business that has been disruptive in the past 12 months, and why?</strong><br>
          The best disruptive start-ups are the ones that change the way we do things for ever by creating a better option that we feel that we can't live without. Uber has been getting some bad press lately but what they've achieved in such a short time is incredible. I am a fan of connected communities and fascinated by how easily technology apps can cut out the middle man in order to play the role of a broker on a very large scale. Transferwise, AirBnb, TaskRabbit are all marketplace models that connect people.
           <br><br>
           In terms of new businesses I like Lobster, a user content marketplace aiming to disrupt the stock photo market
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has being named in the Future 50 helped you to achieve?</strong><br>
            It's great to be recognised and get a stamp of approval. It has opened doors to mentoring and advice.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Did it change the way you think or approach business?</strong><br>
            It made us think about how competitive the UK start up scene is and how important it is to get your name out there. I changed the way I thought about PR and have included business profiling as an important part of achieving growth
            <br><br>
            <strong>Has it opened up any opportunities?</strong><br>
            Not directly but we used it to market ourselves to investors.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What sort of businesses are you hoping to see in the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            Ones that recognise that the world is changing, that the way we work, the way we live and the way we shop will never be the same and ones that take a risk in trying to define what that change will be.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What advice would you give to businesses hoping to make the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            Know your USP, have a good revenue model and a solid growth strategy.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What do you think the biggest challenges UK business are currently facing?</strong><br>
            Financing - it's not always the best companies that get financed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Are there any other messages you would like to see communicated?</strong><br>
            The start-up world diversity problem (especially gender diversity)

      <div class="content">
        <img src="sites/default/files/wb/simon.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:20px; width:25%">
        <p style="font-size:0.85em;">
            <strong>Can you give us a brief overview of you and your business?</strong><br>
            Sure, Hiring-Hub.com makes it easier for companies to find, and work with third-party recruitment agencies. It’s an online marketplace: it’s free to upload your vacancy on the platform, and when you do you specify a fee that you’d be willing to pay a recruitment agency if they found you a candidate you wanted to hire. If you hire, you pay the fee. If not, you pay nothing. We have nearly 1000 approved recruitment agencies in our network, so one of them is bound to have the right candidate. If anything, it’s crowdsourcing for recruitment!
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has been your biggest achievement in the past 12 months?</strong><br>
            Getting profitable. We’ve grown well over 100% year-on-year, and we hit break even in March 2014 and have since grown further, organically, and with a relatively small team, to achieve month-on-month profit. This, to me, is significant as in the early days we were proving the concept, and I feel that we have done that now – it works! By getting the company to profit, we’ve now proven the business model too, which makes it far easier to plan our growth. We also secured investment in November last year to really accelerate growth in 2015. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>How have you been disruptive in your market during that time?</strong><br>
            Our model has been described by its customers as “a breath of fresh air” within what is a fairly traditional sector. Our sole aim is to make recruitment easier and faster for everyone – both companies and recruitment agencies – by providing a neutral environment through which they can trade together easily online. It's proving to fill specialist vacancies three times faster than offline, so it's disruptive but, more importantly, it works. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why is being disruptive so important in the current business/economic climate?</strong><br>
            I don’t really believe it is. I mean, you can setup a normal business, do normal things, and build a good solid business. That, however, has never really excited me. We’re on a mission to fundamentally change an industry, and make recruitment better by taking it online. It’s a bigger goal than simply building a successful business. And it’s what drives me and the team. It just so happens to be disruptive too. It’s in Hiring-Hub.com's DNA not to accept the status quo and to seek ways to improve something. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Is triggering change in your market, or creating a new one, critical to success?</strong><br>
            Yes, absolutely. People told us they didn’t like cold calls from recruitment agencies. They told us they couldn’t find decent candidates quick enough. They told us they didn’t feel like they were getting good value. They told us that managing recruitment agencies on their preferred supplier list took up too much of their time. So we built Hiring-Hub.com – the change they were looking for.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What in your view is a great example of a business that has been disruptive in the past 12 months, and why?</strong><br>
            I like what the guys at Lovespace are doing. Ditto VentureFounders, who are taking a different approach in what is getting a very ‘crowded’ crowdfunding market – if you’ll pardon the pun. Plus there are a few more firms up here in Manchester, where Hiring-Hub.com is based, that are doing interesting things, like Formisimo, Wakelet and ResponseTap.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has being named in the Future 50 helped you to achieve?</strong><br>
            It gave us a platform through which companies could find us, so it helped boost brand awareness, and certainly resulted in new business. As a growing company that’s our focus, so anything that contributes to that has to be a good thing, right?
            <br><br>
            <strong>Did it change the way you think or approach business?</strong><br>
            No. I mean, there was no fundamental shift. I guess what it did do was validate that we were on the right track, so we kept plugging away.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Has it opened up any opportunities?</strong><br>
            Yes, going back to my point on new business, we got a good bit of PR coverage from the award which stirred up a flurry of new customers posting vacancies on the marketplace, and those customers are still with Hiring-Hub.com today. It also supported our fundraise, again validating our product and business model, making it more attractive to investors.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What sort of businesses are you hoping to see in the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            I respect anyone that builds a business, whether it’s disruptive or not. However, personally I like businesses that do things differently, that look for ways to make something better. That, like Hiring-Hub.com, have innovation in their DNA.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What advice would you give to businesses hoping to make the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            Be honest, and really think about who you are, what you’re all about, and how you can tell a story that will ensure you get noticed in what will be a deep pool of great businesses.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What do you think the biggest challenges UK business are currently facing?</strong><br>
            Finding the right talent is a key talking point at the moment, which is good for us at Hiring-Hub.com as we can help firms do exactly that! But it is a challenge and the government really does have to focus on two things: skilled immigration for the short-term skills requirement, and education in the long-term to ensure we’re training a new generation of engineers and software developers.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Are there any other messages you would like to see communicated?</strong><br>
            Hiring-Hub.com is brilliant and if you haven’t used it already, get your jobs on there now – what are you waiting for?! Embrace change! Do it. Now!

    	<h5>Kiyan Foroughi, Boticca</h5>
      <div class="content">
        <img src="sites/default/files/wb/kiyan.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:20px; width:25%">
        <p style="font-size:0.85em;">
            <strong>Can you give us a brief overview of you and your business?</strong><br>
            Boticca is a global, curated marketplace allowing you to connect with talented, up-and-coming independent designers of fashion accessories around the world, discover their stories and shop directly from their studios. We work with over 330 designers in over 40 countries with a member base of nearly 800,000 users. Every month, our designers ship their pieces to over 60 different countries. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has been your biggest achievement in the past 12 months?</strong><br>
            At the end of September, we launched a rebranded website with major improvements across the board in our UI and our post-shipping experience via a partnership with DHL as well as  an innovative content marketing strategy focused on the stories behind our designers and their products. All these changes resulted in over 90% conversion rate growth year-over-year during Xmas. I'm very proud of the team and of this achievement. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>How have you been disruptive in your market during that time?</strong><br>
           We're breaking the traditional distribution channels and removing all the middlemen in between by allowing designers to sell their products to the final customer - making the majority of the retail margins in the process (something they are not accustomed to). 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why is being disruptive so important in the current business/economic climate?</strong><br>
           With a generally sluggish economic and business environment, being disruptive allows you to create growth in industries where there is none. But being disruptive is only one aspect - you also need to be able to execute and have a proper strategy to scale your business with underlying unit economics that make sense.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Is triggering change in your market, or creating a new one, critical to success?</strong><br>
            Not always. There are some businesses who have just been built by improving on something that has already been built. Trello is a fantastic example of that. There is nothing disruptive about what they do. It's just a great product that improved on what was already there. Citymapper is another example along the same lines (building on what Google Maps does or doesn't do).
            <br><br>
            <strong>What in your view is a great example of a business that has been disruptive in the past 12 months, and why?</strong><br>
           I am a big fan of BlaBlaCar - a car ride sharing service based out of Paris that has taken Europe by storm with over 10 million users. We share investors in ISAI and the business is on an absolute tear. It sits at a nice segment of benefitting from issues in the macro-economy, the sharing economy and technology. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>What has being named in the Future 50 helped you to achieve?</strong><br>
            It has provided us with recognition and a ‘stamp of approval’ for the long-term viability and sustainability to the business. It is also great for the team to see all their hard work rewarded by our nomination. It is very important to celebrate our successes - something which is easy to forget when you're in a start-up and always busy working on the next thing.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Has it opened up any opportunities?</strong><br>
            We've been in touch with other winners of the Future 50 following our nomination. It has created a little networking group of entrepreneurs and executives from the various companies selected where we share lessons learnt and help each other out.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What sort of businesses are you hoping to see in the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            It would be great to see more businesses focused on Ed-tech and healthcare from a sector standpoint. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>What advice would you give to businesses hoping to make the next Future 50 list?</strong><br>
            If you can answer these questions in a favourable manner, I think you're well on your way to making the next Future 50 list: 1)    What makes you unique?; 2)    What makes/will make you large?; and 3) What makes you sustainable?
            <br><br>
            <strong>What do you think the biggest challenges UK business are currently facing?</strong><br>
            Financing - it's not always the best companies that get financed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Are there any other messages you would like to see communicated?</strong><br>
            I think the biggest challenge is the upcoming EU referendum stemming from the UK government backing itself into a corner. Leaving the EU would be disastrous for the tech space in general. Freedom of mobility and the fact that from London you can cover all of Europe (and more) pretty much makes it an attractive hub to set up a business. Taking that away (because the EU will not allow the UK to have its cake and eat it too) would force certain businesses to re-think London as an HQ.
