<h3> 	How we collect your information</h3>
<div class="blog-article">
<div class="left-column">
<p> 			We collect information about you in a number of ways. For example, directly from you when an online application is completed, when you give us information or provide feedback whilst the organisation has a loan with us or afterwards. We also collect information from outside sources such as credit bureaux and customer service providers.</p>
<p> 			In addition to the personal and financial information you submit, we may collect information about your computer including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type - for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.</p>
<p> 			This is statistical data about browsing actions and patterns. We may also obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer, which again does not identify any individual. This information is sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server which enables the webserver to identify and track the web browser. For more information about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" rel="nofollow" title="All about cookies">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.

Please note that third parties who advertise on our site may also use cookies, but we do not have access to or control over them.</p>
<p> 			We want to provide you with the best possible service, so calls to Everline may be recorded and/or monitored for quality checks and staff training. Recordings may also be used to help us combat fraud.</p>

<div class="blog-article">
<div class="left-column">
<p> 			We may use data that identifies the business or its director(s), partner(s), member(s) or guarantor(s) (&ldquo;your personal data&rdquo;) to: assess any application for credit; manage your loan(s); perform statistical analysis; develop and improve our products; update your records; assess ongoing lending risks; identify, prevent, detect or tackle fraud, money laundering and other crime; carry out regulatory checks; keep you informed about your loan; carry out market research and related purposes.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3> 	Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs)</h3>
<div class="blog-article">
<div class="left-column">
<p> 			When you apply to us for a loan, we will check the following records about the director, partner, or member that signs this agreement on behalf of the organisation (the &ldquo;main applicant&rdquo;):</p>
<ul>
<li> 				our own records;</li>
<li> 				records of CRAs;</li>
<li> 				records of FPAs.</li>
</ul>
<p> 			We check the records of CRA databases which relate to the main applicant&rsquo;s personal and business activities.</p>
<p> 			We will make checks such as assessing the application for credit and verifying identities to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage our relationship with you.</p>
<p> 			The agencies will link your records to those of your financial associate(s), including any previous names. These links will remain on your files until you or they tell the agency that you are no longer financially linked and the agency accepts this.</p>
<p> 			When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on the credit file of the applicant(s) that may be seen by other lenders. This footprint differs from a consumer lending footprint and is less likely to impact the main applicant&rsquo;s ability to obtain personal finance in the future, however, large numbers of credit applications within a short time period may impact the main applicant&rsquo;s ability to obtain business finance in the future (as a director or a linked individual), this is applicable whether the loan has been accepted or declined.</p>
<p> 			The CRAs supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.</p>
<p> 			Where you borrow from us or guarantee a loan, we will give details of your loan(s)/account(s) and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow, or guarantee a loan, and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt and, in some cases, the length of time that the debt remains outstanding. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted. We will not report such activities on a CRA database which contains information on your personal, non-business activities where this is contrary to our obligations at law, we will report such activities against the business.</p>

<h3> 	Fraud</h3>
<div class="blog-article">
<div class="left-column">
<p> 			If you give us false or inaccurate information and we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud or we identify fraud we may record this and will also pass this information to fraud prevention agencies and it may also be passed onto other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention. We and other organisations may also access and use such information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when (i) checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities; (ii) managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities; (iii) recovering debt; (iv) checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance and (v) checking details of job applicants and employees. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</p>
