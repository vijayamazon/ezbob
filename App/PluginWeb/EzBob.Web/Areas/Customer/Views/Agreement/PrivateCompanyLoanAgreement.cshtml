        2.3 You irrevocably grant us the right and authorise us to automatically debit,

        Account, using the debit card(s) nominated by you and associated with the Primary
        and/or Alternative Payment Accounts, for all or part of any sums outstanding on

		2.4 You must therefore ensure there are sufficient funds in the account to cover 
		payment on the scheduled repayment date. If we are unsuccessful in collecting full 
		payment on a scheduled repayment date we will charge you a £20.00 missed payment 
		fee if scheduled payment is not received by us in full within 7 days of when due, 
		and an additional £20.00 seven days later if you have still not paid the entire scheduled 
		payment. We may try to debit your Primary Payment Account at a later stage and on more 
		than one occasion on the scheduled repayment date, and/or subsequent dates, 
		for all or any part of the Repayment amount due. If you have provided us with details 
		of an Alternative Payment Account and we are unsuccessful in collecting payment from the Primary Payment 
		Account, we may seek payment from the Alternative Payment Account and on multiple occasions, 
		for all or any part of the amount due, as we determine necessary until full repayment is made.

        2.5 Prompt payment is essential. If you are late in paying, you will pay us interest
        on the amount due from when it is due until it is actually received by us at the
        rates of interest shown above. Therefore, in the event your payment is not immediate
        (i.e. real time) and consequently payment does not reach our bank for a further
        few days, interest will continue to accrue at the above rate until payment does
        in fact reach us. Please also see Clause 10.3 concerning late payments and other
        fees.

        is received, followed by any interest due and payable in relation to arrears, any
