                In the event you fail to make two or more of the scheduled repayments, and you owe

                Also if you do not repay your loan in full and on time we will continue to charge
                interest on the outstanding credit balance. The rate of interest will be the same
                as shown above for the final month. Interest after default is calculated daily and applied to the outstanding
                balance every calendar month (or when the outstanding balance is repaid in full

            Alternative Payment Account in order to collect the money, either in one payment

            Missing payments could have further severe consequences, including legal proceedings,
