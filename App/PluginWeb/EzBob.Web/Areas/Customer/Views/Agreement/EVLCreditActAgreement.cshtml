    Also if you do not repay your loan in full and on time we will continue to charge
    interest on the outstanding credit balance. The rate of interest will be the same
    as shown above (for the final month). Interest after default is calculated daily and applied to the outstanding
    balance every 30 days (or when the outstanding balance is repaid in full if earlier).
</p>
<p  style="text-align: justify" >

    £50.00 (“default fee”).

        7. You must accept the loan and sign the Agreement confirming acceptance of the

<dl>
    <dt><b>Payment</b> </dt>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        8. Upon execution of the Agreement we will advance the Loan Amount into your nominated
        bank account referred to herein as the Primary Payment Account. Any other account
        nominated and/or maintained by you shall be herein referred to as the Alternative
        Payment Account.
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        9. You agree to repay us the total amount payable on the scheduled repayment dates
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        10. You irrevocably grant us the right and authorise us to automatically debit,
        on a continuing basis, the Primary Payment Account and/or the Alternative Payment
        Account, using the debit card(s) nominated by you and associated with the Primary
        and/or Alternative Payment Accounts, for all or part of any sums outstanding on
        or after the date upon which sums become due.
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        11. You must therefore ensure there are sufficient funds in the account to cover
        payment on the scheduled repayment date. If we are unsuccessful in collecting full
        payment on a scheduled repayment date we will charge you a £40.00 missed payment
        fee on each scheduled repayment date where payment the entire scheduled payment
        is not received by us. We may try to debit your Primary Payment Account at a later
        stage and on more than one occasion on the scheduled repayment date, or subsequent
        dates, for all or any part of the repayment amount due. If you have provided us
        with details of an Alternative Payment Account and we are unsuccessful in collecting
        payment from the Primary Payment Account, we may seek payment from the Alternative
        Payment Account and on multiple occasions, for all or any part of the amount due,
        as we determine necessary until full repayment is made.
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        12. Prompt payment is essential. If you are late in paying, you will pay us interest
        on the amount due from when it is due until it is actually received by us (credited
        to our account) at the applicable rate of interest shown above. Please also see Clauses 20
        and 21 below concerning late payments charges. Therefore, in the event your payment
        is not immediate (i.e. real time) and consequently payment does not reach our bank
        for a further few days, interest will continue to accrue at the above rate until
        payment does in fact reach us.</p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        13. Your obligation to make repayments to us will be satisfied by making payments
        to us by debit card or as otherwise agreed in writing by us.

<dl>
    <dt><b>Ending the Agreement and Early Repayment</b> </dt>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        14. You may end the Agreement at any time by repaying the full amount you owe under
        the Agreement at that time, without penalty or premium.
    </p></dd>
    <p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        You may also make an early repayment of a portion of the credit at any time (without
        penalty or premium) and any such early repayment will be applied to the amount due
        on the next rescheduled payment date (and any excess to the amounts due on the following
        repayment date(s)). Upon any such partial early repayment the amounts payable on
        the remaining repayment dates shall be recalculated by applying the applicable interest
        rate applied to the outstanding balance of the credit. Any such changes will be
        reflected on the dashboard and in the statement of account you have the right to
        obtain from us in accordance with the 1974 Act.
    </p>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        15. You agree that we may demand repayment of the full amount owed by you under

        25. When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your
        credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including
        the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.</p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        26. We will make checks such as; assessing this application for credit and verifying
        identities to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. We may also make periodic
        searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us.
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >

        28. Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your loan(s)/account(s) and
        how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time,
        CRAs will record the outstanding debt and, in some cases, the length of time that
        the debt remains outstanding. This information may be supplied to other organisations
        by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover
        debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether
        settled by you or defaulted.

        information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.</p></dd>

        31. If you are making a joint application or tell us that you have a spouse or financial
        associate, we will link your records together so you must be sure that you have
        their agreement to disclose information about them. CRAs also link your records
        together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as
        you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break
        that link.

        to countries whose data protection laws are less strict than in the UK. If so, we
        will ensure the information is held securely to standards as least as good as those
        in the UK and only used for the purposes set out in this clause.

        This is called a ‘subject access request’, which you can make by writing to <a href="mailto:support@ezbob.com">support@ezbob.com</a>.
        A fee may be payable, but we will not charge you until we have told you how much

        35. If you want to make a complaint about Orange Money Ltd you can email <a href="mailto:support@ezbob.com">support@ezbob.com</a>,
        with brief details of your complaint and your account number. Our Customer Service
        staff will acknowledge your complaint by email within 5 working days. We will try
        to sort out your complaint quickly once you have contacted us. If we cannot do this,
        we will tell you about the procedures we have for sorting out complaints. These
        procedures are set out below. If we need to investigate your complaint further to
        respond fully, we will tell you and keep you regularly updated. If a further investigation
        is required one of our staff will investigate and send you an initial response,
        having had access to an officer with the authority to settle the complaint (including,
        where appropriate, an offer of redress). Where appropriate, the member of staff
        investigating the complaint will not be any staff member who was directly involved
        in the subject matter of the complaint.</p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        36. If you want to make a complaint to the Consumer Credit Trade Association (“CCTA”),

    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        37. If you need an independent third party to mediate in resolving the complaint
        before the involvement of the Financial Ombudsman, CCTA provides its members with
        a Code of Practice Conciliation Service.</p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        38. The service is directly associated to member’s compliance with the provisions
        of the CCTA Code of Practice. Complaints against a member who has not adhered to
        the Code of Practice, cannot be dealt with under the service.</p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        39. Once a request to conciliate is made the CCTA will attempt to liaise between
        us and you customer in order to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all concerned,
        as quickly as possible.
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        40. In the unlikely event that conciliation fails to resolve the complaint you may,
        after a period of eight weeks have elapsed from the date of receipt of the initial
        complaint, refer the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman (FOS).
    </p></dd>
    <dd><p  style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;" >
        41. You cannot use the CCTA conciliation scheme if your complaint has been decided
        by the Financial Ombudsman Service or a court.
