<p style="text-align: justify;">Also if you do not repay your loan in full and on time we will continue to charge interest on the outstanding credit balance.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We may also charge all costs and expenses (including enquiry agents, debt collections agents and legal costs) reasonably incurred by us in enforcing this Agreement.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Each repayment will be used:</dt>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">a) first to pay the interest that has accrued on the outstanding balance (i.e. the outstanding loan amount and interest due on the outstanding balance);</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">b) then towards repaying any charges resulting from the loan being in arrears (i.e. the missed payment fee and any charges due to any collection agency or legal expenses;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Missing payments could have severe consequences, including legal proceedings and could make obtaining credit in the future more difficult.</p>

    <dt><strong>Loan Approval</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">6. If and when we provisionally approve your loan application, actual payment of the loan amount is subject to:</p>
        <dl>
            <dd>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 60px;">i. us ensuring that the information you gave us was not inaccurate or deficient in any respect (if we discover that it was, then the Agreement will be void and where appropriate may be reported to credit reference and fraud agencies);</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 60px;">ii. us checking your credit reference file and the information you provide to assess the affordability of the loan.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">7. You must accept the loan and sign the Agreement confirming acceptance of the Agreement and its associated Terms and Conditions before the acceptance deadline, which will be communicated to you at the time of your loan application.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>Payment</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">8. Upon execution of the Agreement we will advance the Loan Amount into your nominated bank account referred to herein as the Primary Payment Account. Any other account nominated and/or maintained by you shall be herein referred to as the Alternative Payment Account.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">9. You agree to repay us the total amount payable on the scheduled repayment dates</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">10. You irrevocably grant us the right and authorise us to automatically debit, on a continuing basis, the Primary Payment Account and/or the Alternative Payment Account, using the debit card(s) nominated by you and associated with the Primary and/or Alternative Payment Accounts, for all or part of any sums outstanding on or after the date upon which sums become due.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">11. You must therefore ensure there are sufficient funds in the account to cover payment on the scheduled repayment date. If we are unsuccessful in collecting full payment on a scheduled repayment date we will charge you a &pound;{{LatePaymentCharge}} missed payment fee if the entire scheduled payment is not received by us within 7 days of when due, and an additional &pound;{{AdministrationCharge}} seven days later if you have still not paid the entire scheduled payment. We may try to debit your Primary Payment Account at a later stage and on more than one occasion on the scheduled repayment date, or subsequent dates, for all or any part of the repayment amount due. If you have provided us with details of an Alternative Payment Account and we are unsuccessful in collecting payment from the Primary Payment Account, we may seek payment from the Alternative Payment Account and on multiple occasions, for all or any part of the amount due, as we determine necessary until full repayment is made.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">12. Prompt payment is essential. If you are late in paying, you will pay us interest on the amount due from when it is due until it is actually received by us (credited to our account) at the applicable rate of interest shown above. Please also see Clauses 20 and 21 below concerning late payments charges. Therefore, in the event your payment is not immediate (i.e. real time) and consequently payment does not reach our bank for a further few days, interest will continue to accrue at the above rate until payment does in fact reach us.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">13. Your obligation to make repayments to us will be satisfied by making payments to us by debit card or as otherwise agreed in writing by us.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>Ending the Agreement and Early Repayment</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">14. You may end the Agreement at any time by repaying the full amount you owe under the Agreement at that time, without penalty or premium.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">You may also make an early repayment of a portion of the credit at any time (without penalty or premium) and any such early repayment will be applied to the amount due on the next rescheduled payment date (and any excess to the amounts due on the following repayment date(s)). Upon any such partial early repayment the amounts payable on the remaining repayment dates shall be recalculated by applying the applicable interest rate applied to the outstanding balance of the credit. Any such changes will be reflected on the dashboard and in the statement of account you have the right to obtain from us in accordance with the 1974 Act.</p>
<dl>
    <dd>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;">15. You agree that we may demand repayment of the full amount owed by you under the Agreement if you:</p>
