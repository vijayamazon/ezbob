    <p class="strong">THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CONTAIN IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REGARDING THE FACILITY. THESE TERMS AND PROVISIONS ARE BINDING UPON YOU UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT BY YOUR ELECTRONIC EXECUTION.</p>
</div>
<h4>2. Repayments:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>You irrevocably grant us the right and authorise us to automatically debit, on a continuing basis, the bank account you have designated as your primary bank account (<span class="strong">&ldquo;Primary Re-Payment Account&rdquo;</span>) and/or the Alternative Re-Payment Account for the repayment of each Draw pursuant to the applicable repayment schedule and the terms of this Agreement. Any other account nominated and/or maintained by you shall be herein referred to as the Alternative Re-Payment Account.</li>
    <li>You must ensure there are sufficient funds in the account to cover payment on a scheduled repayment date. If we are unsuccessful in collecting full payment on a scheduled repayment date we will charge you a &pound;20.00 missed payment fee for each scheduled repayment date where the entire scheduled payment is not received by us within seven days of when due and an additional &pound;20.00 seven days later if the scheduled payment still has not made in full. We may try to debit your Primary Re-Payment Account at a later stage and on more than one occasion on the scheduled repayment date, and/or subsequent dates, for all or any part of the Repayment amount due. If you have provided us with details of an Alternative Re-Payment Account and we are unsuccessful in collecting payment from the Primary Re-Payment Account, we may seek payment from the Alternative Re-Payment Account and on multiple occasions, for all or any part of the amount due, as we determine necessary until full repayment is made.</li>
    <li>Prompt payment is essential. If you are late in paying, you will pay us interest on the amount due from when it is due until it is actually received by us at the rates of interest shown above. Therefore, in the event your payment is not immediate (i.e. real time) and consequently payment does not reach our bank for a further few days, interest will continue to accrue at the above rate until payment does in fact reach us.</li>
    <li>Your obligation to make Repayments to us may be satisfied by making payments to us by debit card or as otherwise agreed in writing by us.</li>
    <li>Any payments the Customer makes are allocated as follows: first to pay off any arrears, then to meet the Repayment expected to be made at the time the payment is received, followed by any interest due and payable in relation to arrears, any charges and finally to reduce the amount owed on the Facility.</li>
</ol>
<h4>3. Pre-Conditions to a Confirmation</h4>
<p>We shall not be obliged to issue an Approval for any request for a Supplier Payment unless the following conditions are satisfied on the date on which the request is made:</p>

    <li>The unused balance of your Credit Limit is sufficient to cover the applicable Draw;</li>
    <li>The availability as security for the Facility of any existing security is confirmed to the satisfaction of the Creditor;</li>
</ol>

<h4>5. Interest</h4>

<p>The Customer shall pay to the Creditor any expenses incurred by the Creditor in enforcing or preserving its rights under this Agreement and the security with interest thereon at the interest rate applicable to the Facility, which may include expenses that the Creditor incurs after as well as before any judgment or decree.
