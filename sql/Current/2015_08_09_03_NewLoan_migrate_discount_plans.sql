-- SortOrder field defines order of entries (ORDER BY SortOrder ASC, DiscountPlanEntryID DESC)
-- and not number of repayment period. Entry is always related to repetition period. I.e. if
-- the same plan is applied to monthly repaid loan and to weekly repaid loan and an entry in
-- the second position says "-10%" that means that in the former case customer receives 10%
-- discound for the second month while in the latter case customer receives 10% discount for
-- the second week.
-- Value "0.1" in InterestRateDelta means "10%", value "-0.05" means "-5%".
